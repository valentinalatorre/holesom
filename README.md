# holesom
HOLESOM is a ML tool based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for identifying and characterizing massive black holes (MBHs) using multiwavelength photometric data. It enables classification, parameter estimation, and handling of incomplete data without retraining.

HOLESOM requires Python 3.9+ and the following dependencies:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sompy
- joblib
- pickle

For installing sompy, visit the [SOMPY GitHub repository](https://github.com/sevamoo/SOMPY). 

HOLESOM is described in [La Torre & Pacucci, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951) (accepted for publication on ApJ). This paper provides a detailed explanation of the methodology and implementation of HOLESOM.
